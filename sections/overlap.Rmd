# Question 1: The Words Included in Instructional Resources

One possible source of meaningful variability has to do with the words included in instruction: Do instructional resources agree about which words are important in early print vocabulary acquisition? If different resources agree about the words to be prioritized for instruction[^overlap-1], then students learning within these programs would have similar experiences - at least in terms of the words taught. Alternatively, if resources differ in their contents, it would suggest that the students that learn different programs have different experiences with printed words. Variability of this kind is important because it suggests different conceptualizations of what is important in early reading development, leaving aside issues of the relative efficacy of one approach versus another.

[^overlap-1]: See resource descriptions for a full account of the teaching methods associated with each approach. Nonetheless, each approach involves some amount of word memorization.

## The Degree of Overlap of Words Across Sources

```{r intersect_sources, include=FALSE}

intersect_words_ = wcbc %>% 
  filter(word %in% intersect_words) %>% 
  select(word, wcbc_rank) %>% 
  arrange(-desc(wcbc_rank)) %>% 
  mutate(final = str_c(word, ' (*', wcbc_rank, '*)')) %>% 
  select(final) %>% 
  pull(final)

#intersect_words_ = c(intersect_words_, c('', ''))

intersect_words_table = matrix(intersect_words_, nrow = 4, ncol = 7)

```

The resources differ in basic ways in which special words are described and aggregated. Each has their own term for them, though they are very often described in similar theoretical terms (see methods), and the average frequency of the words (among other properties) vary across sources (Table XX), in many cases substantially.

```{r SourcesDesc, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table_desc = all_lists %>% 
  group_by(source, word) %>% 
  summarise(childes_freq = first(childes_freq),
                    tasa_freq = first(tasa_freq),
                    wcbc_freq = first(wcbc_freq),
                    letters = first(letters),
                    syllables = first(syllables),
                    morphemes = first(morphemes)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(source) %>% 
  summarise(CHILDES = round(mean(childes_freq, na.rm = T)),
            CHILDES_sd = round(sd(childes_freq, na.rm = T)),
            TASA = round(mean(tasa_freq, na.rm = T)),
            TASA_sd = round(sd(tasa_freq, na.rm = T)),
            WCBC = round(mean(wcbc_freq, na.rm = T)),
            WCBC_sd = round(sd(wcbc_freq, na.rm = T)),
            Letters = round(mean(letters, na.rm = T)),
            Letters_sd = round(sd(letters, na.rm = T), digits = 2),
            Syllables = round(mean(syllables, na.rm = T)),
            Syllables_sd = round(sd(syllables, na.rm = T), digits = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(CHILDES = str_c(CHILDES, " (", CHILDES_sd, ")"),
         TASA = str_c(TASA, " (", TASA_sd, ")"),
         WCBC = str_c(WCBC, " (", WCBC_sd, ")"),
         Letters = str_c(Letters, " (", Letters_sd, ")"),
         Syllables = str_c(Syllables, " (", Syllables_sd, ")")) %>% 
  select(source, CHILDES, TASA, WCBC, Letters, Syllables)
      

terms_ = tibble(Source = c("Dolch", "Fountas & Pinnell", "Fry", "Fundations", "Kilpatrick", "Wonders"),
                Term = c("Sight Word", "Words to Know", "Instant Word", "Trick Word", "Irregular Words", "High Frequency Words"))

all_lists %>% 
  group_by(source) %>% 
  distinct(word) %>% 
  summarise(N = n()) %>%
  left_join(table_desc) %>% 
  mutate(Source = case_when(source == 'dolch' ~ 'Dolch',
                            source == 'fry' ~ 'Fry',
                            source == 'fundations' ~ 'Fundations',
                            source == 'kilpatrick' ~ 'Kilpatrick',
                            source == 'wonders' ~ 'Wonders',
                            source == 'fountas_pinnell' ~ 'Fountas & Pinnell')) %>% 
  select(-source) %>% 
  select(Source, everything()) %>% 
  apa_table(caption = "Basic Descriptive Data for All Instructional Sources")

```

Across the six instructional sources included for analysis here, only `r length(intersect_words)` of all unique words are shared across all sources (`r round(length(intersect_words)/length(unique(all_lists$word))*100, digits = 1)`% of types). These words tend to be very common words, all ranking in the top 20% of words by frequency. This set of words is shown in Table X.

```{r intersectTable, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
intersect_words_table %>% 
  apa_table(caption = "The 28 Words Common across All Instructional Sources with Rank Frequency", note = "Words are arranged in descending frequency, and rank frequency is provided in parentheses and is calculated from Wisconsin Children's Book Corpus.", col.names = NULL, escape = FALSE)
```

```{r}
plot_data = all_lists %>% 
  group_by(word) %>% 
  summarise(count = first(count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(count) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/length(unique(all_lists$word)),
         n_prop = paste(n, ' (', round(prop*100, digits = 0), '%)', sep = ''))

```

This overlap can be seen visually in the diagram in Figure 1. Any overlapping portion of the diagram represents the overlap from the sources specified by that region, with the outer portions of the figure showing words unique to a specific source and no others. The very center of the figure represents those words that are common across all sources.

```{r venn, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap='A diagram depicting the overlap in words across sources. Raw counts are provided, with a percentage provided in parentheses showing the percentage of all unique words across all sources that a particular overlapping set represents. Sources can be identified by the outline color of the set. The figure was generated using the ggVennDiagram package in R (Gao, 2022).'}

```

The number of words that are unique to a single resource is high by comparison, with `r max(plot_data$n)` (representing `r max(plot_data$prop)`% of all unique words). Of these words, the program that possesses the most unique words is the Kilpatrick program, which has `r length(words_unique_to_kilpatrick)` of the words unique to a single program, representing `r length(words_unique_to_kilpatrick)/length(unique(all_lists$word))` of all words in all programs[^overlap-2]. The number of unique words decreases as the number of resources increases (Fig 2), which demonstrates the general tendency for programs to select words in an idiosyncratic fashion; it becomes increasingly unlikely that programs agree on important words for instruction the more programs one considers.

[^overlap-2]: See outer rim of Figure 1 in region labeled "Kilpatrick".

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.cap='Few words are shared by all resources (6 total, the far right hand of the x-axis). At the other extreme, many words are unique to one source (560, left hand side of figure).', fig.width=7}

The words present only in a single resource vary in terms of their structure and meaning. These words include relatively uncommon words like "yacht", "sovereign", "spatula", "whom", "etiquette", and "gnat" to words that are quite common, like "shoe", "snow", "dry", "last", "seem", and "easy". A sample of 50 of these words with their frequencies can be found in Table X (a full list of these words can be found in the supplement online).

```{r WordInOneSource, include=FALSE}
words_in_one_source = c("mountains", "next", "plant", "real", "sea", "seem", "state", "area", "birds", "covered", "cried", "easy", "figure", "himself", "hours", "king", "map", "mark", "music", "north", "numeral", "pattern", "plan", "products", "pulled", "reached", "rock",  "room", "stand", "step",  "told",  "town", "travel", "unit",  "usually",    "vowel", "waves", "breakfast", "cousin", "dance", "daughter", "neighbor", "library", "paste", "ache", "acne", "acreage", "actual", "aisle", "algae")

```

tibble(word = words_in_one_source) %>% 
  left_join(wcbc) %>% 
  select(word, wcbc_rank) %>%
  arrange(-desc(wcbc_rank)) %>%
  mutate(wcbc_rank = as.character(wcbc_rank),
         wcbc_rank = case_when(is.na(wcbc_rank) ~ "NP",
                               TRUE ~ wcbc_rank)) %>%
  mutate(final = str_c(word, ' (*', wcbc_rank, '*)')) %>%

  matrix(ncol = 5) %>% 
  apa_table(caption = 'A sample of 50 words unique only to a single resource (an no other resources) is shown. Words are provided with measures of rank frequency taken from the WCBC. Words that are not present in that corpus are marked with "NR", indicating that they are very infrequent in texts written for children.', col.names = NULL)

```

## Discussion

One might reasonably assume that instructional approaches would identify similar words words for instruction in the classroom. This would indicate shared assumptions about the words that are important for reading vocabulary instruction. Based on the data aggregated for this study, this is clearly not the case. Only 28 words are shared by all six resources analyzed here, representing only 3% of the all unique words across all resources.

By contrast, many more words (`r all_lists %>% filter(count == 1) %>%  nrow()`) are isolated to a single resource, representing over half of the unique words that can be found across all six programs. This suggests that instructional approaches tend to select words in an idiosyncratic way, not bound by selection principles that are similar to those of other programs. The tendency to idiosyncratically select words that are in no (or few) other programs varies across the resources as well. For example, the Kilpatrick program has the strong tendency to select words not selected by other programs (326 of all words across six programs are unique to Kilpatrick, equaling 32% of all words; Figure 1). Others are more likely to select words that at least some of the other programs also select (e.g. Wonders contains only 19 words unique to it and no other program, and Dolch contains 42 - 2% and 4% of all words respectively; Figure 1). Moreover these findings suggest something troubling about the experiences of children learning to read from these popular instructional resources: their experiences differ in terms of the words that they learn how to read.

The next section concerns the properties of the words found in these resources, considering the possibility that programs agree on the structure of the words contained in the programs despite selecting different words for use in the classroom.

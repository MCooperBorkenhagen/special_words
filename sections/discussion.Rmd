# General Discussion
Words are fundamental units in language and in reading instruction. The instructional resources we have analyzed all have in common that certain words in English are prioritized for teaching, all focusing on some combination of (a) the words’ structural properties in terms of letters and sounds and (b) the words’ frequencies. There is noteworthy disagreement among programs both about which words should be included and about those properties that matter most in selecting words. Only 3% of the words across all unique words are present in all six resources (3% of words), and most words belong to a single source and no others (56% of words). Programs vary considerably in terms of the properties of the words they contain. Some select the most frequent words in print, like the Fry (1980) list, which contains words that are on average 1.69 standard deviations more frequent than the average of words from the TASA corpus. Kilpatrick, on the other hand, tends to select words that are much closer to the average frequency of words from child-directed print (.68 standard deviations in frequency).

Considerable variation is also seen for other lexical variables: age of acquisition, consistency, imageability, number of letters, and number of syllables. If educational approaches agreed on the properties of the language that matter for instruction, we would likely not see such variability across the different measures considered in the analyses here. 

We have also demonstrated a method that considers word frequency and consistency jointly, given the relevance of these two variables in selecting words for early print vocabulary. The method is explained both graphically (see Figures 8, 9, and 10) and quantitatively (see Figure 10, Table 11, and appendix). This method describes where a word fits in the frequency-consistency distribution, and measures a word's position from the extreme point in the distribution (Figure 10 and Table 11). The approach offers a reproducible method with a concrete (visual) interpretation. When comparing programs on the distribution of words using this method (Figure 11), we see additional variability. Again here, the Fry, Dolch, and Wonders lists tend toward one extreme (selecting words that are highly ranked in frequency-consistency) where Fundations and Kilpatrick tend towards the other.

## Instruction about irregular words
A number of different approaches to teaching irregular words are used in instructional practice today, though the experimental evidence on learning to read these words is limited [@Colenbrander2020]. @Colenbrander2022 found evidence that mispronunciation correction and spelling outperformed passive reading. Their study included few words during training (N = 12) and generalization outside the training items was not observed in any learning condition. Direct instructional strategies also include teaching students rules that allow students to partially decode such words, including instruction about some rules that have limited application to irregular forms (e.g. "ui" in "penguin"). Some programs focus on teaching students to identify parts of words that lead them to be irregular (the Fundations program includes this form of instruction for their "Trick Words"). A third approach is to treat spelling-sound mappings as a statistical learning problem, structuring the learner's experiences so that they can pick up on patterns across words [e.g. @Apfelbaum2013]. This method leverages the inductive learning mechanisms known to be at play in reading development [see @Seidenberg2020 for discussion], while also avoiding spending already-scarce instructional time on aspects of printed words (e.g., rules) that don't generalize across forms. This latter approach can be used alongside statistical analyses we've demonstrated here that allow for the empirical identification of words that can form these instructional ensembles.

In summary, we have demonstrated a number of ways in which instructional resources differ in the words they select for instruction. Our results suggest that both researchers and educators, perhaps especially curriculum authors, need to find more systematic ways to identify words for special instructional attention. Ideally words could be identified based on a model of how words are learned that shows how and why properties such as frequency and consistency, as well as imageability, and age of acquisition, among others, affect learning and skilled performance. Lacking a fully realistic model we have offered an intermediate step: choosing words based on the conjunction of two important factors, frequency and consistency.

## Limitations
Only a subset of possible programs have been selected for analysis here. Those that participated in analyses were included due to their popularity, and a more comprehensive sample could no doubt be obtained. Likewise, the programs here were selected not because they are matched perfectly with respect to their instructional priorities and methods. Future work could consider programs that report to implement more specific shared theoretical perspectives about the development of word recognition skills in order to extend these findings to approaches that are more narrowly matched.

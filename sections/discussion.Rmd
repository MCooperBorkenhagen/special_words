## A Different Conception of Special Words
We've outlined something fundamental about learning a quasiregular writing system like English: frequency and consistency are integrally related in that consistency is just frequency at a different level of grain within the word. It follows from this that there are principled ways in which to determine the special words of the system: they are those the self-select as outliers with regard to the consistency and frequency dimensions calculated across words.

### With diagonal


```{r FrequencyConsistencyPlot2}
wcbc %>% 
  filter(word %in% unique(all_lists$word)) %>%
  arrange(-desc(consistency)) %>% 
  mutate(consistency_rank = seq_len(n())) %>%
  arrange(desc(wcbc_freq)) %>% 
  mutate(freq_rank = seq_len(n()),
         word = case_when(word == "i" ~ "I",
                          TRUE ~ word)) %>% 
  filter(freq_rank < 300 & consistency_rank < 300) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(freq_rank, consistency_rank, label = word)) +
  #geom_label_repel(position = position_jitter(height = 100)) +
  geom_label_repel() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Rank Frequency", y = "Rank Inconsistency")


```


We can talk through what the quadrants are, interpreting them. Focusing in on the

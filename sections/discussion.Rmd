# General Discussion
Words are fundamental units in language and in reading instruction. The instructional resources we have analyzed all have in common that certain words in English are prioritized for teaching, all focusing on some combination of (a) the words’ structural properties in terms of letters and sounds and (b) the words’ frequencies. There is noteworthy disagreement among programs both about which words should be included and about those properties that matter most in selecting words. Only 3% of the words across all unique words are present in all six resources (3% of words), and most words belong to a single source and no others (56% of words). Programs vary considerably in terms of the properties of the words they contain. Some select the most frequent words in print, like the Fry (1980) list, which contains words that are on average 1.69 standard deviations more frequent than the average of words from the TASA corpus. Kilpatrick, on the other hand, tends to select words that are much closer to the average frequency of words from child-directed print (.68 standard deviations in frequency).

Considerable variation is also seen for other lexical variables: age of acquisition, consistency, imageability, number of letters, and number of syllables. If educational approaches agreed on the properties of the language that matter for instruction, we would likely not see such variability across the different measures considered in the analyses here. 

We have also demonstrated a method that considers word frequency and consistency jointly, given the relevance of these two variables in selecting words for early print vocabulary. We've explained this method both graphically (see Figures 8, 9, and 10) and quantitatively (see Figure 10, Table 11, and appendix). This method describes where a word fits in the frequency-consistency distribution, and measures a word's position from the extreme point in the distribution (Figure 10 and Table 11). The approach offers a reproducible method with a concrete (visual) interpretation. When comparing programs on the distribution of words using this method (Figure 11), we see additional variability. Again here, the Fry, Dolch, and Wonders lists tend toward one extreme (selecting words that are highly ranked in frequency-consistency) where Fundations and Kilpatrick tend towards the other. 

Our results suggest that both researchers and educators, perhaps especially curriculum authors, need to find more systematic ways to identify words for special instructional attention. Ideally words could be identified based on a model of how words are learned that shows how and why properties such as frequency and consistency, as well as imageability, and age of acquisition, among others, affect learning and skilled performance. Lacking a fully realistic model we have offered an intermediate step: choosing words based on the conjunction of two important factors, frequency and consistency.

## Limitations
Only a subset of possible programs have been selected for analysis here. Those that participated in analyses were included due to their popularity, and a more comprehensive sample could no doubt be obtained. Likewise, the programs here were selected not because they are matched perfectly with respect to their instructional priorities and methods. Future work could consider programs that report to implement more specific shared theoretical perspectives about the development of word recognition skills in order to extend these findings to approaches that are more narrowly matched.

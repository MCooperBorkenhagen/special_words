# Discussion
Words are an organizing unit of the language in reading instruction. These instructional resources all have in common that certain words in English are prioritized for teaching, all focusing on some combination of words that have atypical structure and those that are very common. As a result, the words themselves are a meaningful unit of analysis for the purposes of determining the extent to which these programs agree about what matters in early reading instruction.

It turns out that there is noteworthy disagreement among these resources about which matter most. Only 3% of the words across all unique words are present in all six resources (3% of unique words).


## A Different Conception of Special Words
We've outlined something fundamental about learning a quasiregular writing system like English: frequency and consistency are integrally related in that consistency is just frequency at a different level of grain within the word. It follows from this that there are principled ways in which to determine the special words of the system: they are those the self-select as outliers with regard to the consistency and frequency dimensions calculated across words.

```{r FrequencyConsistencyPlot2}
wcbc %>% 
  filter(word %in% unique(all_lists$word)) %>%
  arrange(-desc(consistency)) %>% 
  mutate(consistency_rank = seq_len(n())) %>%
  arrange(desc(wcbc_freq)) %>% 
  mutate(freq_rank = seq_len(n()),
         word = case_when(word == "i" ~ "I",
                          TRUE ~ word)) %>% 
  filter(freq_rank < 300 & consistency_rank < 300) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(freq_rank, consistency_rank, label = word)) +
  #geom_label_repel(position = position_jitter(height = 100)) +
  geom_label_repel() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Rank Frequency", y = "Rank Inconsistency")

We can talk through what the quadrants are, interpreting them. Focusing in on the

# General Discussion
Words are an organizing unit of the language in reading instruction. These instructional resources all have in common that certain words in English are prioritized for teaching, all focusing on some combination of (a) words that have atypical structure and (b) those that are very common. It turns out that there is noteworthy disagreement among programs both about which matter most and about those properties that matter most in selecting words. Only 3% of the words across all unique words are present in all six resources (3% of unique words), and most words belong to a single source and no others (56% of all words).

## A Different Conception of Special Words
We've also demonstrated that words can be specified using empirical means based on observable properties known to be important for learning: their frequency and consistency. Figure XX outlines such a distribution, showing the top 100 words based on a joint ordering of these two variables.



```{r fig.cap='The plot shows the top 100 words ranked jointly in terms of frequency and inconsistency. The word closest to the origin is "and", representing the word that is most frequent and atypical when both properties are considered. Words that fall toward the diagonal have similar values in the rank of each variable. Note that the word "and" is measured as a low consistency word in the Chee et al. (2020) data despite it having many neighbors with similar pronunciations, as in "hand" and "band".'}
wcbc %>% 
  filter(word %in% unique(all_lists$word)) %>%
  arrange(-desc(consistency)) %>% 
  mutate(consistency_rank = seq_len(n())) %>%
  arrange(desc(wcbc_freq)) %>% 
  mutate(freq_rank = seq_len(n()),
         word = case_when(word == "i" ~ "I",
                          TRUE ~ word)) %>% 
  filter(freq_rank < 300 & consistency_rank < 300) %>%
  ggplot(aes(freq_rank, consistency_rank, label = word)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "grey45", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_label_repel() +
  theme_apa() +
  labs(x = "Rank Frequency", y = "Rank Inconsistency")

```


The resources studied in this paper vary substantially with respect to how well the words they contain account for properties defined by the two-dimensional space defined for all words across all sets (see Figure XX above). Some lists (Dolch and Fry for example) have fairly good coverage with relatively few words. The Wonders program has strong coverage of the space (from Figure XX), but this is at the expense of including vastly more words than other programs; the more words you select, the more likely you are to cover all ranges of the distribution of frequency and consistency.

# Introduction

A major step in becoming a reader is being able to recognize and understand sufficient words to comprehend text. These include the "high frequency" words that occur in most texts, as well as content words such as _dinosaur_ and _skeleton_ that are common in texts about specific topics [@Adams2011]. With this level of skill, learners can be said to have achieved escape velocity: they can increase their reading skill and acquire other types of knowledge through reading itself, with decreasing reliance on external feedback. Early reading instruction focuses on these goals.

Although approaches to instruction vary, they generally assume that beginning readers will need to memorize some number of high frequency words because of the nature of written English. Many common words can be decoded (“sounded out”) using knowledge of letter-sound relationships (“phonics”). However, teaching and learning these correspondences is time-consuming and the sheer number of them is daunting (ref.). Memorizing words is the alternative to delaying reading until sufficient spelling-sound mappings are learned. Moreover, memorization is apparently necessary for the many high frequency words whose pronunciations differ from those specified by standard phonics rules. These include words such as _have_, _said_, _was_, _were_, _some_, and other function words (prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, determiners) essential to constructing sentences.

Thus, beginning readers’ progress depends on gaining facility with common words, including those with atypical spelling-sound correspondences. Some number of words need to be memorized to jumpstart reading while knowledge of spelling-sound mappings develops. Memorization involves learning associations between the spelling of a word and its primary meaning and/or pronunciation. Historically, there have been a variety of proposals about which words should be treated this way, as well as methods of instruction. 

In a classic article, @Dolch1936 developed a list of 220 “sight words” that he thought essential for beginning readers to learn. This list (with minor updates) remains a widely-used resource. All of these words can be learned by treating them as visual patterns associated with meanings and pronunciations, as in the “sight word” method Dolch preferred. This approach is time-consuming because such associations must be explicitly taught and memorizing them requires practice. However, the Dolch list also contains many words that are decodable if readers learn the relevant phonics rules (e.g., can, make, fast). Learning such rules also takes time, but it reduces the number of word that have to be learned via simple association ("memorized"). 

Numerous alternatives to and modifications of the Dolch list have been proposed by scholars, most notably @Fry1957. Commercial curricula have also proposed their own lists. The term “sight word” has fallen into disfavor because of its association with discredited instructional approaches (ref.); other labels such as “trick,” “snap”, and “heart” words are employed instead. Although the terms v In this article, toary, they reflect a shared view that some number of common words need special attention at the onset of reading instruction. To be theory- and curriculum-neutral, we will refer to them as “special words”.

Our study examined the treatment of special words in a sample of commonly-used instructional materials. These include popular commercial programs (Fountas & Pinnell's "Phonics, Spelling, and Word Study Guide", McGraw-Hill's _Wonders_, and _Fundations_ from Wilson Language Basics), the Dolch and Fry lists [@Dolch1936; @Fry1957], and "Equipped for Reading Success" [@Kilpatrick2016] which offers instructional guidance on early reading development (but is not generally considered a formal curriculum). These materials were chosen because they are in common use and therefore have a major impact on classroom instruction. Many other curricula and word lists exist, of course; it would not be possible to evaluate all of them. We chose materials that are widely known and represent a variety of approaches and were developed at different times, including both commercial products and materials in the public domain. We will refer to them as “instructional resources.” In the general discussion, we consider some additional approaches as well.

Our primary goal was to identify the points of convergence and divergence regarding the treatment of special words in these resources. Our study builds on previous research by @Kearns2022, who reported a lack of agreement about the contents in the early elementary reading curricula they examined. Our study considered this question in greater detail, using a broad range of instructional materials. How many words are identified as requiring special instruction, what was the basis for choosing them, and what are their properties? A high degree of convergence across resources might be predicted because of their shared focus on teaching very high frequency words, including many with seemingly irregular spelling-sound correspondences. However, the words that are identified could differ from other reasons, such as pressure to limit the number of words that must be memorized, and different assumptions about which words are decodable^[Note though that the investigation of this topic is outside the scope of the research here.].

Specifically, we investigate three questions about instructional resources aimed at teaching early reading skills. First, to what extent do programs agree on the words that are important in early reading instruction? Second, to what degree to programs align based on the properties of the words they contain? Finally, based on the properties that programs identify as important instructional words, can empirical methods be identified that allow us to _derive_ words that are important for instruction?

These empirical questions are important. Although it has been long assumed that some words will have to be treated as special in early reading instruction, little research has addressed whether there is agreement about which words are so designated. A lack of agreement would suggest that beginning readers’ early instructional experiences vary in ways that may affect progress, despite general agreement about the importance of focusing on high frequency words. To foreshadow the results, consistent with @Kearns2022, the treatment of special words in these resources shows a high degree of variability in the words identified and the properties used to identify them. Although they all refer to the frequencies of words, there is little agreement about which high frequency words are included, and similarly for words with irregular pronunciations. These disagreements reflect the fact that the special words were identified based on intuitions about words and their properties rather than explicit theories of how properties of words affect learning. In the general discussion we relate the results to current theories of word recognition and naming, which provide detailed accounts of the impact of frequency, spelling-sound consistency, and other properties of words on learning. Choices about words to include can be based on how they are learned.

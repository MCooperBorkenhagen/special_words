# Introduction

A major step in becoming a reader is being able to recognize and understand sufficient words to comprehend simple texts. These include the very common, “high frequency”  words that occur in most texts, as well as content words such as "dinosaur" and "skeleton" that are common in texts about specific topics [@Adams2011]. Achieving this level of skill is often called “cracking” or “breaking” the orthographic code: the child understands what there is to learn about print (e.g., how letters combine and represent the sounds of words) and has acquired sufficient details to start reading. Learners can be said to have achieved escape velocity: they can increase their reading skill and acquire other types of knowledge through reading itself, with decreasing reliance on external feedback.

Although approaches to instruction vary, they generally assume that beginning readers will need to learn some number of high frequency words through processes other than decoding (“sounding out”) because of the nature of written English. Many common words can be decoded using knowledge of letter-sound correspondences (“phonics”). However, teaching these correspondences is time-intensive and the sheer number of them is daunting (Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989; Venezky, 1989). Instruction often utilizes other means, including memorization, as an alternative to delaying reading until sufficient spelling-sound mappings are learned. Learning through means other than decoding is apparently necessary for the many high frequency words whose pronunciations differ from those specified by standard phonics rules. These include words such as "have", "said", "was", "were", and "some". Many of these are function words (prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, determiners) essential for constructing sentences and which occur in many different kinds of contexts in the language. 

Thus, beginning readers’ progress depends on gaining facility with common words, including those that exhibit atypical spelling-sound patterns. Some number of words need to be learned through processes other than strict decoding in order to jump-start reading while knowledge of spelling-sound mappings develops. This typically requires some sort of memorization, which involves learning associations between the spelling of a word and its primary meaning and/or pronunciation. Historically, there have been a variety of proposals about which words should be treated this way, and strategies for teaching them. While this topic has been the subject of renewed focus in recent years [@Miles2018], there remains lack of consensus about the status of these words in educational programming.  

In a classic article, @Dolch1936 developed a list of 220 “sight words” that he thought essential for beginning readers to learn (for discussion disambiguating instruction and the underlying psychological processes often referred to with the same name, see @Ehri2005). The Dolch list (with minor updates) remains a widely-used resource. Dolch prescribed that all of these words can be learned by treating them as visual patterns associated with meanings and pronunciations. Treating words this way is potentially time-consuming because of the substantial practice associated with doing so. Additionally, the Dolch list also contains many words that are decodable if readers learn the relevant phonics rules (e.g., "can", "make", "fast"; see @Miles2024). Learning such rules also takes time, but it reduces the number of words that have to be learned via other forms of association (e.g., memorization). Numerous alternatives to and modifications of the Dolch list have been proposed by scholars, most notably @Fry1957. Commercial curricula have also proposed their own lists. The term “sight word” has fallen into disfavor, other labels such as “trick,” “snap”, and “heart” words are employed instead^[Different terms are used by different programs. For example, “trick word” is used in Wilson’s Fundations, and “heart words” is a term used in the University of Florida Literacy Institute’s “UFLI” program (which is not analyzed in the study here), and elsewhere. The term “snap word” is associated with an educational product by the same name, but also is used colloquially among practitioners.], each often withe their own rationale and corresponding instructional method. Although the terms vary, they reflect a shared view that some number of common words need special attention at the onset of reading instruction. To be theory- and curriculum-neutral, we will refer to them as “special words”.

## Our Study of Six Resources
Our study examined the treatment of special words in a sample of commonly-used instructional materials. These include popular commercial programs (Fountas & Pinnell's "Phonics, Spelling, and Word Study Guide", McGraw-Hill's _Wonders_, and _Fundations_ from Wilson Language Basics), the Dolch and Fry lists [@Dolch1936; @Fry1957], and "Equipped for Reading Success" [@Kilpatrick2016] a popular book that offers instructional guidance on early reading development (but is not generally considered a formal curriculum). These materials were chosen because they are in common use and therefore impact classroom instruction. Many other curricula and word lists exist, of course; it would not be possible to evaluate all of them. We chose materials that are widely known and represent a variety of approaches and were developed at different times, including both commercial products and materials in the public domain. We will refer to them as “instructional resources” (or simply "resources").

Our primary goal was to identify the points of convergence and divergence regarding the treatment of special words in these resources using a broad range of instructional materials. We asked: How many words are identified as requiring special instruction, what was the basis for choosing them, and what are their properties? A high degree of convergence across resources might be predicted because of their shared focus on teaching high frequency words and words with atypical structure. However, the words that are identified could differ for many reasons, such as pressure to limit the number of words that must be memorized, and different assumptions about which words are decodable. 

These questions are important because of long-standing assumptions about how some words will have to be treated as special in early reading instruction, despite there being little research addressing disagreement about which words are so designated. Agreement across resources would indicate that special words are being treated in a consistent manner, leading to commonalities in learners’ experiences. A lack of agreement would suggest that beginning readers’ early instructional experiences vary in ways that may affect progress, despite general agreement about the importance of focusing on high frequency and irregular words. Lack of agreement might also also reflect differences in assumptions about early reading that could affect children’s progress. To foreshadow the results, these resources exhibit a high degree of variability regarding the words identified and the properties used to identify them. Although word frequency is a factor identified in all resources studied, there is little agreement about which high frequency words are included, and similarly for words with irregular pronunciations. These disagreements reflect the fact that the special words were mainly identified based on intuitions about words and their properties rather than explicit theories of how properties of words affect learning. In the general discussion we describe how word properties relate to learning, and provide a simple method for identifying words in terms of their frequency and the extent to which they contain atypical structure. The method is flexible enough such that it can be used to understand the relationship of different words in terms of essential learning properties. It also provides a way to compare the special words included in the six resources studies here, and could also be used to select special words in the future.

## Words Included in Instructional Resources and Amount of Overlap
Do these instructional resources agree about the words identified as needing special attention in early reading? The short answer to this question is no: only 28 of the 973 different words (3%) occur in all 6 resources (Table 3).  All are high frequency words, ranking in the top 20% of words by frequency; all have atypical spelling-sound correspondences (e.g., "said" does not rhyme with other "-aid" words).  This overall result indicates that there is not an obvious or consensus set of words treated as special.

### How Many Words are in How Many Resources
In contrast to the small number of words common to all the resources, the number of words that are only included in a single resource is high, 526 (54%). These words vary greatly with respect to structural properties such as typicality of spelling or pronunciation, frequency, and meaning.  They include relatively uncommon words like “yacht”, “sovereign”, “spatula”, “whom”, “etiquette”, and “gnat” as well as very commonly used words such as “shoe”, “snow”, “dry”, “last”, “seem”, and “easy”. See Table 4 for a sample of 50 of these words and their frequencies and the supplemental materials for the complete list. The variability among these words speaks to a lack of common criteria for selecting words and word properties in these materials.


```{r WordInOneSource, include=FALSE}
words_in_one_source = c("mountains", "next", "plant", "real", "sea", "seem", "state", "area", "birds", "covered", "cried", "easy", "figure", "himself", "hours", "king", "map", "mark", "music", "north", "numeral", "pattern", "plan", "products", "pulled", "reached", "rock",  "room", "stand", "step",  "told",  "town", "travel", "unit",  "usually",    "vowel", "waves", "breakfast", "cousin", "dance", "daughter", "neighbor", "library", "paste", "ache", "acne", "acreage", "actual", "aisle", "algae")

```

Turning to the occurrences of words across resources, Figure 1 (Panel A) shows how many words appear in how many of the resources. The bar on the left shows that most words occur in only one resource (54%). Much smaller percentages occur in 2-6 resources. For 2-5 resources the percentages range from 7-15%. The value drops to 3% for all six, due to the impact of the Kilpatrick materials, which overlap least with other resources. The lack of agreement across resources is not due to a few idiosyncratic items, insofar as the percentages of words shared by either four or five resources are similar to those for two to three (A). Figure 1 (Panel B) shows these data excluding the Kilpatrick data. Overlap increases but is still quite low (12-19%).  The number of words appearing in all resources increases from 28 to 79 (3-12%).  With the Kilpatrick program excluded (B), levels of overlap are somewhat higher, but there still are not a large number of near-misses (i.e., high percentages of words in the 4-5 overlap groups).

Figure 2 shows for each resource the proportion of its special words that occur in other resources.  Panel A shows the results using all six resources. A few main patterns are apparent. The Dolch, Fry, and Fountas & Pinnell results are very similar, likely because the two later resources relied heavily on the earlier Dolch article. Fundations contains the most words that are present in all other resources: 15% of the Fundations words appear in all six lists; 41% appear in all five lists when excluding Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick’s list is the most idiosyncratic, with most of the words (328, 77%) included in no other resources.

Figure 3 provides a comprehensive summary of the distribution of words over resources and amount of overlap using a Venn Diagram. The 28 words shared across all sources is seen in the center of the figure. The outermost regions show the words that were only found in one resource. Other regions of the figure show the number and percentage of words that overlap in two or more resources. The colors of the outer lines of each region indicate the resources that are used to calculate the region.

```{r venn, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="85%", fig.cap = "\\small Caption text", fig.cap='A diagram depicting the overlap in words across sources. The data are the number of words and percentages of all special words included in a source or in multiple sources. Percentages are calculated relative to all words across all sources. Values  less than 6 represent less than 1% of all words and are shown as 0%. Sources are indicated by line color (Dolch = brown; Fountas and Pinnell = green; Fry = orange; Fundations = light blue; Kilpatrick = purple; Wonders = red). The color of the shade in an area represents the number of words in a given region (darker = more words). The outer colors of the lines demarcating a region indicate the resources involved. For example, the center of the plot is encircled by all six colors, therefore representing those words that are common to all six programs (28 words; 3% of all words).

### Summary of Words Included in Each Resource and Their Overlap
To summarize, whereas the concept of treating some words as special is common to all the resources, the words they identify as such are not. Few words appear in all six; over half appear in a single resource. With the Kilpatrick items removed, the percentage of unique words decreases to 39% and there is somewhat greater overlap among the remaining resources. Still, the striking aspect of the data is the degree to which the resources differ in words that are selected.

We next consider whether there might be more commonality across resources than the above data suggest. Although they differ in the exact choice of words, perhaps they agree on which types of words should be identified in terms of their properties. In order to examine this possibility we looked at each set of words in terms of a range of properties known to be important in reading development: frequency, age-of-acquisition, consistency, imageability, and length (number of letters and number of syllables). 

## Word Frequency
Early instruction focuses on words that occur frequently in texts. Unlike properties such as  number of letters, frequency can only be estimated. This is done by examining the number of times a word occurs in a relevant sample of text (corpus). Previous research has used several corpora for this purpose, which sometimes yield different results [@Gries2006].  We conducted analyses using several measures of frequency, which yielded similar results in the case of the words contained in the resources studied here. Here we present analyses using frequencies from the TASA norms [@Zeno1995], which have been widely used in other research (analyses employing other frequency measures are included in the supplemental materials). TASA provides grade-level estimates of word frequency, based on samples of books for different grade levels. Data for texts through 3rd grade were used in order to match the grade levels associated with the instructional resources.  

The following analyses employed rank frequencies, where numerically lower values indicate higher frequencies, which were then standardized using the 19,468 words from the TASA corpus through grade three. This results in a distribution of rank frequency for each word in the corpus set in relation to the variability of rank frequency in the TASA corpus. The standardized rank frequencies were used to examine how much the scores for words in each resource differ from the normative TASA distribution and to compare the resources to each other. Summary statistics for each resource are provided in Table 5.

Figure 4 depicts every word in each of the six lists arranged by increasing frequency, where each word appears as a line. The presence of a black line indicates that the word is included in the program. If it is not in the program, the line is blank. The figures provides visual evidence of the inconsistencies in the selection of words and in the treatment word frequency in the six resources, abstracting away from the identities of individual words (see supplemental materials for a larger figure that shows the identities of the words). Inconsistencies across resources is visualized as horizontal discontinuities in lines. Differences in the treatment of word frequency are apparent from the density of black lines at different frequency levels. Dolch, Fry, and Wonders contain high concentrations of very high frequency words. Fountas & Pinnell and Fundations contain fewer of these words. The Kilpatrick materials are the obvious outlier, with heavy representation of low frequency words.

### Frequencies of Special Words Compared to Words in General
All instructional resources contain words that are, on average, more frequent (lower standardized rank frequency) than the average word from TASA, as indicated by each mean value for standardized rank frequency being negative (Table 5). This is unsurprising given that all of the resources are intended to contain common words. We also examined a statistical model of each resource’s frequency distribution against zero (the TASA mean). Table 6 provides descriptive data and Table 7 shows the model results from for the six resources.

Fry tends to contain the highest frequency words as well as the least amount of variability. On the other end is Kilpatrick. This set of words is much lower frequency on average than any of the other resources. The variability in frequency for this set is noteworthy as well. Not only are the averages for Kilpatrick much lower frequency than any of the other instructional resources, the spread of frequency values for that source is higher as well. Note that the Kilpatrick distribution is the only to include words above the mean of words in TASA (i.e., very low frequency words).

Figure 5 shows these trends for the six lists. The point estimate is shown for each resource in each panel, with standard deviations shown as boxes above and below the estimate in Panel A and standard errors in Panels B and C. The scale in Panel A is such that one can see each list’s distribution relative to the TASA mean, shown as a dashed line (zero due to standardization). Standard deviations are shown in this panel because the small size of the standard errors render them imperceptible at this scale. The data displayed in this way give a sense of the variation within sources. The idiosyncrasies of the Kilpatrick list are also apparent: that resource contains more variable word frequencies and the lowest frequency words are far towards the extreme (i.e., high on the y-axis). Panel B is a zoomed in version of this plot, but showing standard errors from the statistical test of each distribution against zero (zero = the TASA mean). This view permits better comparison across the resources and relative to the mean for the six resources (dotted line). Panel C shows the same data shown in Panel B excluding the Kilpatrick data. This more clearly shows the differentiation of Wonders at one end (reliably containing lower frequency words than the other four) and Fry at the other (tending to contain the highest frequency words). Dolch, Fountas & Pinnell, and Wonders exhibit comparable distributions for word frequency. See Tables 6 and 7 for means and estimates from the model to supplement the graphical depiction in this figure.

### Coverage of the Most Frequent Words
To what extent do these resources include the most frequent words in grade-appropriate texts? We examined this by calculating the proportion of the most frequent words in TASA that a given resource contains. For this purpose frequencies were divided into bands: 50, 100, 500, and 1000 words. The results for all six resources follow a common pattern: they tend to exhibit more coverage for the most frequent 50 and 100 words, less so for the most frequent 500 and even less for the most frequent 1000. This general finding is not surprising. However, the resources vary in how they cover words in these bands. 

Wonders contains the most words, with 440, so it is perhaps unsurprising that it shows greater coverage in all frequency bands. It nonetheless contains only 65% of the most frequent 500 words. By contrast, the Dolch and Fry words obtain almost comparable coverage with fewer words (less than 3/4 of the number of words in Wonders).  All three have greater than 75% coverage for TASA on the top 50 and top 100 words and around half of the top 500 words. Fountas and Pinnell exhibit slightly lower levels of coverage than those three, with Fundations demonstrating even less coverage than Fountas and Pinnell. The coverage for Kilpatrick is very low, even for the most frequent 50 words. This is fact is notable given that Kilpatrick contains the second most number of words behind Wonders, and over 100 words more than the Dolch list.

### Summary of Word Frequency
In answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section, Figure 5 indicates that the words in Wonders, Fry, Dolch, and Fountas & Pinnell have similar frequencies even though they are largely different words. As other analyses have indicated, the Kilpatrick words differ the most from the others, but the Fundations words stand out because they include fewer of the words in each frequency band.  

All resources contain words more frequent than the average frequency from TASA. However, Kilpatrick’s set contains many words of lower frequency than the mean frequency from TASA (shown with points falling above the zero line in Figure 5A), a trend that differentiates this program from the rest. Kilpatrick’s resource aside, all other resources do in fact contain “high frequency” words when comparing against this normative distribution. This is good and expected given that they advertise themselves as such. Nonetheless, the extent to which they do so varies considerably. These trends are recapitulated when we examine the coverage of the most frequent words in TASA (e.g., Figure 6), though the relative distributions of each program when examining the data in this way shifts a bit. Here, Wonders, Fry, and Dolch do very well in their coverage of the top 50 and top 100 words from TASA: they contain almost every one of these words. Wonders contains the best coverage of the top 500 and 1000 words from TASA (65% and 41% of these words, respectively). Analogous to the comparison of average frequency relative to the mean TASA frequency, Fundations and Kilpatrick do least well in coverage of the top 50, 100, 500, and 1000 words. These resources contain only 16% (Fundations) and 1% (Kilpatrick) of the most frequent 1000 words from TASA, which is much lower than the 41% contained by Wonders. It important to keep in mind that Wonders contains the most words in general, with 440. 

To summarize, the concept of “high frequency words” figures prominently in discussions of early reading instruction. The results here suggest that although the concept is familiar, it does not designate a specific set of words.  The six resources differ in terms of which words they contain and the frequency of those words.

## Other Word Properties
The following analyses examined other properties of words known to affect reading. Orthography-to-phonology consistency refers to how consistently a spelling pattern is pronounced across words [@Chee2020; @Jared2002].  A word is consistent if its pronunciation is consistent with neighboring words with similar spellings. Consistency varies in degree. "Must", for example, is highly consistent with neighbors such as "dust", "gust", and "musk". "Have" is inconsistent because most "-ave" words are pronounced as in "save". "Save" is less consistent than "must" (because one of its neighbors is "have"). For these analyses we used the average feedforward consistency using the norms from @Chee2020 for body-rime units across syllables, an aggregate measure of the consistency of a word regardless of length. Numerically lower scores indicate lower consistency. Age of acquisition (AoA) is a rating of the age at which words were learned [@Kuperman2012]. Numerically lower scores indicate earlier acquisition. AoA is correlated with word frequency (e.g., $\rho$ = -.47 in the TASA words included in the analyses here) but accounts for additional variance associated with early experience with words. Imageability [@Stadthagen2006] is a rating of how much a word evokes a visual image; it is correlated with concreteness but somewhat more sensitive (e.g., a word such as "red" rates low on concreteness but high on imageability). Lower scores indicate lower imageability. Number of letters and number of syllables were also counted and included in these analyses.  

As with word frequency, the measures of these additional word-level variables were standardized in the TASA corpus (levels 1-3) in the same way that frequency was standardized (described previously). Raw values for these variables were standardized instead of rank values as was the case for frequency. Table 8 provides a description of what low values on each scale can be interpreted as, and example words. Low values are described for these variables because words in all distributions in the data described tend to be on the low end of the scale for each variable (and tending to be below the mean on the variable in the TASA corpus). 

```{r WordPropertyScalesDescriptions, warning =FALSE}

tibble(Variable = c("Frequency (rank)", "AoA", "Consistency", "Letters", "Syllables", "Imageability"),
       Description = c("More common in print", "Learned early in life", "Differs in pronunciation to similarly spelled words", "Contains few letters", "Contains few syllables", "Is difficult to create a mental image of"),
       Example = c('"the"', '"my"', '"shall"', '"I"', '"my"', '"is"')) %>% 
  apa_table(caption = "Description and Examples of Words for Low Values for Each Variable",
            note = 'Each example provided comes from the lowest end of the distribution for each variable. For example, the word "my" is low on age of acquisition and the word "shall" is inconsistent in pronunciation to other words that share similar spellings (e.g., "ball" and "call").')

```

### Differences in Word Properties by Resource
Table 9 provides summary data and Figure 7 shows the point estimates from statistical tests of each resource against zero (TASA mean) for each variable. See appendix (Tables 12 - 16) for results of the statistical tests corresponding to the figure. Colors represent the five different variables of interest within each panel and the dotted line refers to the average for the six sources for a given variable. The dashed line shows the mean for all variables in all words in TASA.

Scores for the resources almost all land below the TASA mean for each variable (below the dashed line). All resources contain words that are learned earlier than the average word in TASA (lower in AoA), are less consistent (lower consistency; except for Dolch), are less imageable, have fewer letters, and fewer syllables. Additionally, each resource rarely falls on the mean for all resources (i.e., has a bar that falls on the dotted line), which suggests noteworthy variability across resources for each variable. 

Fundations, Kilpatrick, and Dolch are, in general, associated with more extreme positions relative to the group mean across each of the variables - though in different directions. Fundations favors words with lower age-of-acquisition, lower consistency, lower imageability, and more syllables than the rest. Kilpatrick tends towards words with higher AoA (learned later) and more letters. Dolch contain words that are more consistent and more imageable, though shorter (in terms of letters and syllables). Fry, Fountas and Pinnell, and Wonders tend to be more moderate than the others, exhibiting more instances where their distribution straddles the mean for all resources (and each showing no instance of being the extreme value on any given variable). 

Except for the Dolch words' distribution for consistency, differences between the source distribution on each word-level variable relative to the normative distribution (TASA) are all statistically significant based on a statistical test of the mean against zero (paralleling the tests conducted previously on the frequency distributions).

### Summary of Other Word Properties
In summary, we asked how the words these resources compared in terms of other properties of words known to affect learning to read.  We found that the different sets of words associated with the resources also differ with respect to other important properties. Noteworthy variability exists across the instructional word lists along all 6 variables studied, greater than that seen with word frequency.  

Regarding spelling-sound consistency, the resources split into two subgroups: those that contain words that are below the mean for the six resources (Fundations, Wonders, Kilpatrick) and those that are above that mean (Dolch, Fry, and Fountas & Pinnell). Fundations and Kilpatrick are most clearly differentiated at one extreme: These two programs contain words that are in general more inconsistent than the others. This tendency fits with the characterization of the Fundations and Kilpatrick programs, whose instruction tends to focus on idiosyncratic print structure of words in English. Interestingly, Fundations targets words that are both irregular and frequent, where Kilpatrick’s explanation focuses primarily on the irregularity of the words selected (see Methods section on this program for further description). Nonetheless, Fundations contains words that tend to be more inconsistent than those in Kilpatrick. 

Fundations and Kilpatrick also occupy outlier positions for age of acquisition, though in this case they are on opposite ends: Fundations contains words that are on average the lowest AoA words, and Kilpatrick contains the highest AoA words. The other four programs cluster together, right around the average value for AoA for the six resources. Note that for Fundations, the tendency to contain words that are low in age of acquisition but contain inconsistent print-speech structure characterizes the potential learnability of that program’s words. Their words, while idiosyncratic from the perspective of print and speech are more likely to be words that the child already knows from spoken language. By contrast, Kilpatrick’s words are both inconsistent and are higher in age of acquisition. This will cause words in that set to be more difficult to learn. The words will have fewer neighbors and less likely to be known from speech by the child. This tendency is compounded by their relative infrequency, as described above. 

## Frequency & Consistency
The final set of analyses examine the intersection between frequency and consistency, which is particularly relevant to decisions about early reading instruction. Such instruction typically focuses on words that are used frequently and/or ones that have atypical pronunciations given their spellings (i.e., words that are low in consistency). These properties are related [@Seidenberg1989]: inconsistent words tend to be high frequency words (e.g., "said", "give", "have") but some are lower in frequency (e.g., "aisle", "pint", "plaid"). Words that are inconsistent but used frequently are easier to learn than inconsistent words that are used less often. The following analyses provide a way to visualize this relationship, and how it plays out in the six resources.

A simple approach that lends itself well to visual interpretation is placing a set of words in the two-dimensional space defined by the two variables. The x-axis is ordered in terms of frequency (further right indicates less frequent) and the y-axis is ordered in terms of consistency (further up the axis indicates more typical structure).  The space can be divided into quadrants (Figure 8A):  inconsistent and frequent words are commonly the target of instructional emphasis; consistent and frequent words may be included less often because they can be pronounced using phonics rules; consistent and infrequent words, also correctly specified by phonics rules and also used less often; and inconsistent and infrequent, uncommon words with atypical structure that can be learned later, but only when necessary.

We examined the distribution of each resource's words in the space defined by these two variables. Figure 8B shows the locations of all words from the six resources. 187 of the words (19%) fall into the lower left _frequent but inconsistent_ quadrant. The distribution of words is spread considerably across the four quadrants. Figure 9 shows where each of the resources fall in terms of these four quadrants, exhibiting wide variation across resources, with the darkness of points corresponding to the density of words. These differences are quantified in the next section which describes the amount of coverage of the target (lower left) quadrant of each figure for the six resources.

### Words in the Lower Left Quadrant of Frequency and Consistency
All of the resources include some of the 187 higher frequency-higher inconsistency words (words contained in the lower left quadrant). Table 10 shows the proportion of coverage of the quadrant for each resource (Column 1) as well as the proportion of the resource the words in the target quadrant represents for that resource (Column 2). Wonders has the highest coverage, covering the vast majority of the target quadrant (.89), but it also has the highest number of special words overall (440 words). The distribution of words in that program spreads across all quadrants of the figure, including many words in the “infrequent and inconsistent” category. Compare Wonders to Fry, for example, which contains well more than half the target words (.66), and whose words are less spread across the four quadrants in general.  Consistent with other results, Kilpatrick has the lowest coverage, despite containing a large number of words (2nd most, behind only Wonders).

### Choosing Words Based on Frequency and Consistency
All of the evidence we have presented points to a general conclusion: the methods that are used to identify words that merit special instructional attention yield different results rather than converging on a consensus set of items. The six resources identify different numbers of words with differing properties. In this section we offer an alternative method for choosing such words based on quantifiable properties that are highly relevant for early reading. 

Modern theories of learning have identified frequency and consistency as properties that affect learning to read and skilled word reading [@Houghton1999; @Seidenberg1989; @Plaut1996]. Words that are more frequent tend to be read more quickly [@Balota2004; @Jared1990]. Consistency has a similar effect in that words that are higher in consistency (have more words that are similar in the letters they contain and their pronunciation) are also named faster [@Glushko1979; @Jared1990]. Both properties are graded, such that words fall on a continuum of frequency and of consistency [see @Seidenberg2022 for discussion] and their effects on word naming are also graded. The relationship of these effects are the result of the properties being related; consistency is the result of the frequency with which orthographic and phonological patterns appear across words in the language. As a result, it seems important for children to be able to read very common words, including ones with atypical pronunciations given their spellings (low consistency). However, choosing words for instruction based on one of these properties lets the other property vary. It would therefore be helpful to have a way to take both factors into account in selecting words. That might also permit both dimensions to be covered using a smaller set of words, which would be desirable because instruction about printed words is typically time-consuming.

### A Graded Measure of Frequency and Consistency
We have provided a graphical analysis that demonstrates the organization of words in terms of frequency and consistency by arranging words in their respective quadrants based on these two properties. However, a method of quantifying each word with a single metric that considers both would be helpful. For this purpose, we used the Euclidean distance of each word from the origin in the space defined by frequency ($f$) and consistency ($c$), using their ranks. The distance between the two points in this space is denoted as $d(c, f)$. $n$ is defined as 2 given that we are working in 2 dimensions, where $i$ is summed over the two dimensions and then a square root is applied.


$$
d\left( c,f\right)   = \sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n=2}  \left( c_{i}-f_{i}\right)^2 }
$$



```{r EuclideanDistances1, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency$distance = NA

for (i in seq(nrow(rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency))){
  ic_ = rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency$consistency_rank[i]
  f = rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency$tasa_rank[i]
  
  distance = l2(c(0, 0), c(ic_, f))
  
  rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency$distance[i] = distance
  
  
}

rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency = rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency %>% 
  arrange(-desc(distance)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = seq_len(n())) %>% 
  select(rank, word, distance, tasa_rank, consistency_rank)
```


```{r chee_token_consistency_data, include=FALSE}
chee_token_consistency_corr = rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency %>% 
        left_join(readxl::read_xlsx('../../words/consistency/13428_2020_1391_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx', sheet = 2) %>% 
          filter(word %in% rank_inconsistency_rank_frequency$word) %>% 
          mutate(consistency = case_when(n_syll == 1 ~ ff_1_r,
                                         n_syll > 1 ~ ff_all_r)) %>% 
          select(word, consistency) %>% 
          arrange(-desc(consistency)) %>% 
          mutate(token_consistency_rank = seq_len(n())) %>% 
          select(word, token_consistency_rank)) %>% 
          summarise(cor(distance, token_consistency_rank, use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))

chee_token_consistency_corr = chee_token_consistency_corr[[1]]
```

This method identifies a different set of words than if they are chosen on the basis of frequency or consistency alone, and provides a way of quantifying what is otherwise a visual pattern demonstrated in the quadrant-based analyses described previously. Table 11 shows the top ten words using this measure (see appendix Table 17 for the top 50). Words with high frequency and low consistency are positioned toward the top of this distribution.

The quadrant-based results limit the number of words to those that fall on the median of each axis. Discretizing the words into four groups (quadrants) aids a visual interpretation, but is somewhat arbitrary. Using the distance from point 0, 0 we can examine how each program falls within sets of words defined by this distance, using several different quantities. Here we consider $n \in \{20, 50, 100, 250\}$. Figure 10 shows the top 50 words using this approach for reference, and Figure 11 shows the data for all values of _n_.

Wonders provides the best coverage across all values of _n_, covering all top 20 words by distance, 98% or the top 50 words, 94% of the top 100 words, and 88% of the top 250 words. Both the Fry and Dolch resources have perfect coverage of the top 20 words, and high coverage of the top 50 words (96% and 92% respectively). Fundations and Kilpatrick lists occupy the other end of the extreme, with Kilpatrick ranking last in all proportions across values for _n_. This is somewhat surprising given the focus of Kilpatrick’s resources is on irregular words and that Kilpatrick's list is quite large (425 total words). However, because the list contains relatively infrequent words, the coverage of the sets of top 20, 50, 100, and 250 words remains quite low (especially relative to the other programs). The Fundations list ranks next-lowest overall. While Fundations contains 95% of the top 20 words defined by this variable, its coverage of the top 50, 100, and 250 words are low compared to the others. 

### Summary of Frequency and Consistency
The six programs studied here differ in the extent to which they jointly consider these two variables in selecting instructional words. This can be seen in terms of examining the lower left quadrant of the bivariate distribution of frequency and consistency, as well as examining the top 20, 50, 100, and 250 words in the joint rank distribution (defined by the Euclidean calculation from origin). Wonders shows strong coverage of the top ranking words the join frequency-consistency distribution, as do Fry and Dolch. It is noteworthy that the Fry and Dolch wordlists have high coverage here because they also tend to contain more consistent words on average (e.g, see Figure 7). Relatively low coverage is achieved by Fundations and Kilpatrick, again demonstrating that these two resources differ from the others in terms of the properties of the words they contain. Wonders contains the largest number of words overall, and therefore holds an advantage over the other programs in terms of the likelihood of having strong coverage on these and other variables examined. At the other end of the extreme, Kilpatrick’s resource contains a large number of atypical words in terms of spelling-sound structure, but also tends to contain infrequent words. So these results aren’t as surprising. Fundations relatively low coverage here stands out, however. Their program described their approach to sight word instruction as focusing on words that are “tricky” due to their spelling-sound structure in addition to their frequency. However, Fundations contains only 45% of the top 250 words when considering frequency and inconsistency ranked jointly (by distance).

A hallmark of educational practice is the identification of experiences that when delivered to the student will advance her or his learning in a unique and accelerated way, thus giving the student a privileged path through development. One role of the reading teacher, and of those who develop materials for reading teachers, is identifying word-reading experiences to this end, such that the student can be exposed to words that support quick and effective word reading development. Nonetheless, words can be useful to learning for many different reasons. They can be special because they are common, because they exhibit special structure, because they are relevant for book the child is reading at the time, and so on.

The most common framework used by educators when deciding to teach particular words during early reading development concerns (1) the extent to which the word is common (in the environment of the reader), and (2) whether or not the structure it exhibits is common (across other words in the language). The general assumption is that words that are common and those that have atypical structure should be memorized, and the more common the word is, the higher priority it should have in learning (more common = higher priority).

The former is relatively straightforward: some words are more common than others in books (or other modes of communication), and this can easily be measured (typically by counting up the frequency of occurrence of words across a set of texts). The other part of the framework is more challenging to operationalize because it isn't clear how to tabulate elements of print and speech in service of identifying "common" letter-sound forms across words. This ambiguity exists because the statistical patterns in print and speech vary in their predictability, and while the learning mechanisms that underlie developing knowledge about these regularities are well established, this science has not been translated cleanly to educational practice in teaching and learning concerning reading vocabulary [@Seidenberg2020]. The result of this 

The interest in the relationship between printed and spoken language structure is supported by a variety of research that has shown how important this structure is to the development of skilled reading []. Early on in the development of knowledge about print, readers have to associate printed structure with what they know about speech []. Instruction has the capacity to enhance this learning process, where intensive focus on the relationship with print and speech is well-known to advance both narrow skills of pronouncing novel printed words ("decoding"), and broader reading skills associated with, among other things, understanding words when they are read [].

As a result, it is important to understand both mechanisms through which print vocabulary develop early on, and the types of instruction that can accelerate such development.

Programs of reading instruction that teach print vocabulary (and the resources that support them) vary in how they approach these two related principles of learning to read printed words aloud.

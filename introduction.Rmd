A hallmark of educational practice is the identification of experiences that when delivered to the student will advance her or his learning in a unique and accelerated way, thus giving the student a privileged path through development. One role of the reading teacher, and of those who develop materials for reading teachers, is identifying word-reading experiences to this end, such that the student can be exposed to words that support quick and effective word reading development. Nonetheless, words can be useful to learning for many different reasons. They can be special because they are common, because they exhibit special structure, because they are relevant for book the child is reading at the time, and so on.

The most common framework used by educators when deciding to teach particular words during early reading development concerns (1) the extent to which the word is common (in the environment of the reader), and (2) whether or not the structure within the word is common (across other words in the language). The general assumption is that words that are common and those that have atypical structure should be memorized, and the more common the word is, the higher priority it should have in learning (more common = higher priority). Then, spelling-sound structures that are thought to be reliable and productive across words are taught in order to capture the remaining words in the language - those that don't fall into groups (1) and (2).

The principle stated in (1) is relatively straightforward: some words are more common than others in books (or other modes of communication), and this can easily be measured (typically by counting up the frequency of occurrence of words across a set of texts). Part (2) of the framework is more challenging to operationalize because it isn't clear how to tabulate elements of print and speech in service of identifying "common" letter-sound segments within words. This ambiguity exists because the statistical patterns in print and speech vary in their predictability^[While the learning mechanisms that underlie developing knowledge about these regularities are well established, this science has not been translated cleanly to educational practice in teaching and learning concerning reading vocabulary [@Seidenberg2020]].

Programs of reading instruction that teach print vocabulary vary in how they approach these two related principles of learning to read printed words aloud. However, teaching students to memorize words because they are common and/or because they exhibit atypical structure has become commonplace in the classroom. Words that fall under this umbrella are called many different names ("high-frequency words", "tricky words", "snap words", etc.), though they all have these features in common^[Note that a given approach or program may emphasize each of these features to different degrees, with some focused more narrowly on how common the word is, and other focused on how uncommon the structure is. Nonetheless, these two ingredients are always at play, and almost all approaches emphasize the importance of memorization in learning them.]

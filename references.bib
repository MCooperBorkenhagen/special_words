abstract = {After exploring the origin and development of the Dolch basic word list, a study was undertaken to compare the vocabularies of five recently published basic reading series with the Dolch list. The percentage of Dolch words found in each book of the five reading series was compared to the percentages reported by Dolch in an earlier study. The results of the present investigation agreed remarkably with the various percentages found by Dolch. It was concluded that the Dolch list continues to account for more than fifty per cent of the running words in currently published basic reading series. Since the Dolch list is still up-to-date, teachers should continue to help students master the list by the end of the third grade. {\textcopyright} 1970, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Common Core State Standards emphasize the need for U.S. students to read complex texts. As a result, the level of word complexity for primary-level texts is important, particularly the dimensions of and changes in complexity between first grade and the important third-grade high-stakes testing year. In this study, we addressed word complexity in these grades by examining its dimensions and differences in the texts in three widely used U.S. reading programs. Fourteen measures of word complexity were computed, and exploratory factor analysis established that four dimensions—orthography, length, familiarity, and morphology—characterized word complexity. As expected, the third-grade texts have more complex words than the first-grade texts have in the four dimensions, with the greatest differences in length and familiarity. More surprisingly, the words in the first-grade texts increase in complexity over the year, but overall, the words in the third-grade texts do not. Polysyllabic words are common in texts in both grades, comprising 48% of unique words in first-grade texts and 65% in third-grade texts. Polymorphemic words comprise 13% of unique first-grade words and 19% of third-grade words (for derived words, 3% and 6%, respectively, of all words). Results show that word complexity changes markedly between grades as expected, not only in length and familiarity but also in syllabic and morphemic structure. Implications for instruction and future word complexity analyses are discussed.},

@article{Johns1970,
abstract = {After exploring the origin and development of the Dolch basic word list, a study was undertaken to compare the vocabularies of five recently published basic reading series with the Dolch list. The percentage of Dolch words found in each book of the five reading series was compared to the percentages reported by Dolch in an earlier study. The results of the present investigation agreed remarkably with the various percentages found by Dolch. It was concluded that the Dolch list continues to account for more than fifty per cent of the running words in currently published basic reading series. Since the Dolch list is still up-to-date, teachers should continue to help students master the list by the end of the third grade. {\textcopyright} 1970, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Corpus of Contemporary American English is the first large, genre-balanced corpus of any language, which has been designed and constructed from the ground up as a 'monitor corpus', and which can be used to accurately track and study recent changes in the language. The 400 million words corpus is evenly divided between spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic journals. Most importantly, the genre balance stays almost exactly the same from year to year, which allows it to accurately model changes in the 'real world'. After discussing the corpus design, we provide a number of concrete examples of how the corpus can be used to look at recent changes in English, including morphology (new suffixes -friendly and -gate), syntax (including prescriptive rules, quotative like, so not ADJ, the get passive, resultatives, and verb complementation), semantics (such as changes in meaning with web, green, or gay), and lexis-including word and phrase frequency by year, and using the corpus architecture to produce lists of all words that have had large shifts in frequency between specific historical periods. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

@article{Lewis2022,
abstract = {We investigated how gender is represented in children's books using a novel 200,000-word corpus comprising 247 popular, contemporary books for young children. Using adult human judgments and word co-occurrence data, we quantified gender biases of words in individual books and in the whole corpus. We found that children's books contain many words that adults judge as gendered. Semantic analyses based on co-occurrence data yielded word clusters related to gender stereotypes (e.g., feminine: emotions; masculine: tools). Co-occurrence data also indicated that many books instantiate gender stereotypes identified in other research (e.g., girls are better at reading, and boys are better at math). Finally, we used large-scale data to estimate the gender distribution of the audience for individual books, and we found that children are more often exposed to stereotypes for their own gender. Together, the data suggest that children's books may be an early source of gender associations and stereotypes.},

@article{Seidenberg2020,
abstract = {Can the science of reading contribute to improving educational practices, allowing more students to become skilled readers? Much has been learned about the behavioral and brain bases of reading, how students learn to read, and factors that contribute to low literacy. The potential to use research findings to improve literacy outcomes is substantial but remains largely unrealized. The lack of improvement in literacy levels, especially among students who face other challenges such as poverty, has led to new pressure to incorporate the science of reading in curricula, instructional practices, and teacher education. In the interest of promoting these efforts, the authors discuss three issues that could undermine them: the need for additional translational research linking reading science to classroom activities, the oversimplified way that the science is sometimes represented in the educational context, and the fact that theories of reading have become more complex and less intuitive as the field has progressed. Addressing these concerns may allow reading science to be used more effectively and achieve greater acceptance among educators.},
